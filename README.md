### AdaFace + Whisper Finetuning:
Relies on https://github.com/mk-minchul/AdaFace and https://github.com/openai/whisper/

# Whisper 
pip install -U openai-whisper

Whisper is downloaded automatically. And after istalling it via pip the script (should) run without any problems (it is VERY demanding hardware wise atleast on my pc)

# Adaface
You will currently have to download the code from the repository via git and then just drag the file in there or adjust the depency. https://github.com/mk-minchul/AdaFace
